    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
<p>A probability event can be defined as the set of outcomes of a random experiment. The two types of events in probability are dependent events and independent events.</p>
<p>  The two events are said to be independent events when the outcome of the first event does not show an impact on the outcome of the second event. The example is tossing a coin and rolling a die simultaneously or separately are independent. The formulas to calculate the probability of independent events are along the lines:</p>
<p>  If two events A, B are independent, then the probability of happening A and B is here:</p>
<p><strong>  P(A âˆ© B) = P(A) . P(B)</strong></p>
<p>  For three independent events A, B, C, the probability of happening A, B, C is:</p>
<p><b>  P(A âˆ© B âˆ© C) = P(A) . P(B) . P(C)</b></p>
<p> So, according to the <b>multiplication rule</b> to calculate the probability of the intersection of independent events, multiply the probabilities of each event together.</p>

                        <p>The method to find the independent events probability is enclosed here. Make use of these guidelines to get immediate results.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initially, check whether the given events are independent or not.</li>
                        <li>If independent, then multiply the probability of each event with another.</li>
                        <li>Finally, obtained produt is the independent probability.</li>

                    <p><b>Example: </b>In a survey, a company found that 8 out of 15 buy pens. If four people are chosen at random with replacement, what is the probability that all 4 people buy pens?</p>
                <p>Solution:</p> 
                <p>If four people are chosen at random with a replacement who buy pen, then the probability that all 4 people buy pen is:
                </p> <p>   P(1st person buys pen) = 8/15</p>
                <p>  P(2nd person buys pen) = 8/15</p>
                <p>  P(3rd person buys pen) = 8/15</p>
                <p>  P(4th person buys pen) = 8/15</p>
                <p>  P(all 4 persons buy pen) = 8/15 x 8/15 x 8/15 x 8/15</p>
                <p>   = 4096/50625</p>
                    <p>  The probability that all 4 people buy pen is 4096/50625.</p>
