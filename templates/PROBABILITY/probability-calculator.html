        </div>
	    <div class="card-body">
            <p>In mathematics, the probability is a field of statistics that is utilized to explain the likelihood of an event that is going to occur. A number that always lies between 0 and 1 is probability. When the probability value is equivalent to 1, then something will occur. If not, then something will never occur.</p>
<p>For instance, the probability of flipping a coin and its being tail is &frac12;, because there is 1 way of getting a tail and the total number of possible outcomes is 2 (head or tail).</p>
<h4>Types of Events That Influence Probability</h4>
<p>There are three types of events that impact the probability outcome. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent</li>
<li>Dependent</li>
<li>Mutually exclusive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Basic Probability Formulas</h4>
<p>The probability formula is the ratio of the number of ways an event can appear across the total number of possible outcomes. Thus, the formula can be written as</p>
<p><strong><em>Probability of an event occurring = Number of ways an event can occur / Total number of possible outcomes.</em></strong></p>
<p>A standard formula for the probability of an event to occur:<strong> P(A) = n(A) / n(S)</strong></p>
<p>where,</p>
<ul>
<li>P(A) is the probability of an event happening</li>
<li>n(A) is the number of ways an event can happen</li>
<li>n(S) is the total number of possible outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>A standard formula for the probability of an event that will not occur: <strong>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</strong></p>
<p>where,</p>
<ul>
<li>P(A') is the probability of an event cannot occur</li>
<li>P(A) is the probability of an event occurring</li>
</ul>

	    <div class="card-body">
            <p>Here is the simple procedure that helps you find the probability of an event manually with ease. Take a look at the below steps:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Firstly, we have to identify the number of favorable outcomes.</li>
            <li>Next, find the total number of outcomes.</li>
            <li>Now, utilize the basic formula of the probability of an event (ie., the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.)</li>
            <li>Substitute the values in the probability formula and get the result effortlessly.</li>

            <h4>Solved Example on Probability</h4>
            <p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
            <p>If we toss a coin once, what is the probability of getting tails? Prove it using the probability calculator.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution: </strong></p>
            <p>Given favorable outcomes = 1</p>
            <p>Total number of possible outcomes = 2</p>
            <p>Probability of getting tails = 1/2 or 0.5</p>
            <p>Therefore, the probability of getting tails is <strong>0.5.</strong></p>

     	<p class="answer">The single event probability formulas are as follows:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Probability of event A that occurs P(A) = n(A) / n(S).</li>
         <li>Probability of event A that does not occur P(A') = 1 - P(A).</li>
         </ul></p><hr>
        <p class="question"><strong>3. What are the formulas of multiple event probability?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">The following list will help you learn the multiple event probability formulas:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>P(A) = n(A) / n(S).</li>
        <li>P(A') = 1 - P(A).</li>
        <li>P(B) = n(B) / n(S).</li>
        <li>P(B') = 1 - P(B).</li>
        <li>The probability that both the events occur P(A &cap; B) = P(A) x P(B).</li>
        <li>Probability that either of event occurs P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A &cap; B).</li>

        <p class="question"><strong>4. How to find the probability of two events?</strong></p>
     	<p class="answer">Simply by multiplying the probability first event with the second event, you can calculate the probability of two events. For instance, if the probability of event A is 8/2 and the probability of event B is 4/2 then the probability of two events occurring at the same time is (8/2)*(4/2) = 4 * 2 = 8.</p><hr>
