<ol><li><b>Price Target: </b>Price targets for underlying security determines the probabilities of security hitting those targets. You are allowed to provide one or two price targets to know the probabilities of underlying security closing below, above or between the target date. It can also be adjusted using the chart.</li>
    <li><b>Historical Volatility: </b>It is a measurement of how much previous prices are derived from their average over a period of time.</li>
        <li><b>Target Date: </b>It is used to find the probability that security will close above, below and between the price targets at the specified time.</li>
            <li><b>Standard Deviation: </b>It will plot a single probability cone that shows the price range the underlying is expected to close at on a given date.</li></ol>
