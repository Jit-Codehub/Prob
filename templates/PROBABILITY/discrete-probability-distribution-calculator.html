  <p>The probability distribution is the possibility of each outcome of a random experiment. The two types of the probability distribution that are used for different purposes are Normal or Cumulative Probability Distribution and Binomial or Discrete Probability Distribution.
 </p><p>   A discrete probability distribution is a distribution, where the set of outcomes is should be in discrete nature. An example is when a dice is rolled, then all the possible outcomes are discrete. In binomial distribution, the possible number of outcomes must be 2.</p>

                            <p>    A discrete probability distribution takes the whole numbers from 0. The probability of a discrete random variable is the probability function, which is represented as f(x). Two important requirements for probability function are listed here:
                             </p><ul><li>   f(x) > 0</li>
                             <li> ∑f(x) = 1</li></ul>
                             <p>  A discrete probability distribution can be represented in a couple of different ways. One is using a table and the second is using a graph. The third way is to use a formula for the probability function.
                            </p><ul><li>  Discrete Uniform Probability Function is f(x) = 1/n. Where n is the number of values of x.</li></ul>
                                <p>   Discrete random variables can be explained using the expected value and variance.
                                </p><ul><li>  Expected Value formula is E(x) = ∑x . f(x)</li>
                                    <li> Variance formula is Var(x) = ∑(x - μ)² . f(x)</li>
                                        <li> Standard deviation is SD = √[∑(x - μ)² . f(x)]</li></ul>
                                <p>  The binomial probability distribution is related to the binomial experiment. Every binomial experiment has a sequence of n trials with two possible outcomes in each trial. The outcomes are "success" and "failure" with probabilities of p and q = 1-p. The probability of x success in n trials is given by the binomial probability function.
                                </p><ul><li>  Expected value E(x) = np</li>
                                    <li>   Variance Var(x) = npq = np(1-p)</li>
                                        <li>  Binomial Probability Function f(x) = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>x</sub> p<sup>x</sup> q<sup>n-x</sup></li></ul>
                                <p>   The Poisson probability distribution is helpful when the random variable measures the number of occurrences over an interval of time or space. Probabilities for a Poisson probability distribution can be find using the Poisson probability function.
                                </p><ul><li> Poisson Probability Function formula is f(x) = [μ<sup>x</sup> e<sup>-μ</sup>]/x!</li></ul>
                                <p>  The hypergeometric probability distribution is similar to the binomial probability distribution. In a hypergeometric probability distribution, the number of success is r, N is the population.
                                </p><ul><li>  Expected value formula is E(x) = n(r/N)</li>
                                    <li>Variance formula is var(x) = n(N/r) (1 - r/N) (N-n/N-1)</li>
                                    <li> Hypergeometric probabiity function is f(x) = [<sup>r</sup>C<sub>x</sub> <sup>N-r</sup>C<sub>n-x</sub>]/<sup>N</sup>C<sub>n</sub></li></ul>
